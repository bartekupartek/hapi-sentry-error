## Hapi Sentry Error Reporter

Minimalistic Sentry reporter designed only for Hapi errors. Unlike other libraries it captures headers with payloads for curl with data preparation for better errors reproducing.

**Important!**

- Enable Data Scrubber
- Add Additional Sensitive Fields (Separate multiple entries with a newline, list only leafs of json)
